### Branching Standards
To ensure a smooth development process, adhere to the following branching standards:

1. **Feature Branches:**
   - Create all feature branches from the `development` branch.
   - Use the following naming convention for feature branches: `feature/<descriptive-name>`, for example, `feature/add-login-form`.

2. **Pull Requests:**
   - Once your feature is complete, submit a pull request (PR) to merge it back into `development`.
   - Each PR must be reviewed and approved by **at least one reviewer** before merging.
